# Digital Shelf
So far, this project is the beginning of a backend CRUD app that stores an inventory of items of shelves. The idea being, that it'll help you know what books, movies, music, and TV shows you have on your shelves and where it is. I'm also planning on adding a wishlist for things that you would like to get.

This project is in its very early stages, and in a very alpha state.

# Setup

I'm not going to include setup steps yet, as this project is not in a usable state. This will change in the near future.

If you want to figure out how to get the project running ignoring that fact, I will include that environment variables are used for configuration. Create a .env file in the root of the project dir. It should look like the one below.
```
PLATFORM="dev"
DB_URL=YOUR DATABASE HERE
```
